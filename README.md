# Data-Science

Challenge 2 : 

You are a data scientist at LinkedIn. 
Your colleagues from Marketing want to organize an online marketing campaign for their client, a restaurant in the Bay area.
They have read a lot about social network analysis and ask you to find the 5 most influential people 
on the network who would best promote the restaurant.

You are a smart data scientist, and you know that influence is not enough. 
You have to find the users who are influencers but also located in the right area! 
As you know your dataset perfectly, you are aware that only 40% of the users have provided their location in their profile...


Your challenge is to fill uncomplete profiles and find influencers able to promote a restaurant in the Bay

Compare your strategy to fill the profile with the "ground truth", and compare also different strategies to select the best!
We provide you with a baseline (known) method in order to compare your proposal with its (lower, of course lower) results.
To measure the relevance of your profile filling strategy, you can use accuracy;
what could you do to test your detection of influencers? This step is called the evaluation of your model (cf. CRISP-DM steps).
